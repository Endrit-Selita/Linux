# Understanding the Linux File System

The Linux file system is organised in a hierarchical structure, starting from the root directory (*this is the top level of the file system where your user would live and any other users, and this contains personal directories for each user*).

The root directory is represented by a single forward slash: `/`. All other directories branch off from this root.

## Everything is a file in Linux

Unlike file systems you might be familiar with from Windows or Mac, Linux treats everything as a file.

This includes: 
- devices
- processes
- hardware components etc.

This structure provides a flexible and powerful way to manage your system. Understanding the Linux file system is essential, as it plays a crucial role in navigating and managing your files effectively.
