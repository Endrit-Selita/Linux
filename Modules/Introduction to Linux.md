# Introduction to Linux

Linux is an open-source operating system created by Linus Torvalds.

An open-source operating system means the source code is freely available for anyone to view, use, modify, and share. This encourages collaboration, transparency, and continuous improvement by a global community of developers.

Linux is known for its:
- Security
- Flexibility
- Strong community support

It is the backbone for many many servers, networks, and cloud infrastructures.

Linux is widely used, highly customisable, and cost-effectiveâ€”making it a core skill for many IT and DevOps roles.

There are many versions of Linux, called distributions, each tailored for different purposes.
