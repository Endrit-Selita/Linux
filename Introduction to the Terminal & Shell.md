# Introduction to the Terminal

The **terminal** is a command-line interface (CLI) that allows you to interact with your operating system by typing commands. It's a powerful tool used to:

- Navigate the file system  
- Run scripts  
- Install and configure software  
- Perform various administrative tasks  

When you type a command, is interpreted by the **shell** and gives back the output. We will cover the shell in more detail later, but for now, just know that it's what processes your commands.
